  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

Design Summary
--------------
Number of errors   :   3
Number of warnings :   0

Section 1 - Errors
------------------
ERROR:Place:1205 - This design contains a global buffer instance,
   <memc3_infrastructure_inst/U_BUFG_CLK0>, driving the net, <c3_clk0_OBUF>,
   that is driving the following (first 30) non-clock load pins off chip.
   < PIN: c3_clk0.O; >
   This design practice, in Spartan-6, can lead to an unroutable situation due
   to limitations in the global routing. If the design does route there may be
   excessive delay or skew on this net. It is recommended to use a Clock
   Forwarding technique to create a reliable and repeatable low skew solution:
   instantiate an ODDR2 component; tie the .D0 pin to Logic1; tie the .D1 pin to
   Logic0; tie the clock net to be forwarded to .C0; tie the inverted clock to
   .C1. If you wish to override this recommendation, you may use the
   CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint (given below) in the .ucf file to demote
   this message to a WARNING and allow your design to continue. Although the net
   may still not route, you will be able to analyze the failure in FPGA_Editor.
   < PIN "memc3_infrastructure_inst/U_BUFG_CLK0.O" CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE =
   FALSE; >

ERROR:Place:1136 - This design contains a global buffer instance,
   <memc3_infrastructure_inst/U_BUFG_CLK0>, driving the net, <c3_clk0_OBUF>,
   that is driving the following (first 30) non-clock load pins.
   < PIN: c3_clk0.O; >
   This is not a recommended design practice in Spartan-6 due to limitations in
   the global routing that may cause excessive delay, skew or unroutable
   situations.  It is recommended to only use a BUFG resource to drive clock
   loads. If you wish to override this recommendation, you may use the
   CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint (given below) in the .ucf file to demote
   this message to a WARNING and allow your design to continue.
   < PIN "memc3_infrastructure_inst/U_BUFG_CLK0.O" CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE =
   FALSE; >

ERROR:Pack:1654 - The timing-driven placement phase encountered an error.

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:LIT:243 - Logical network c3_p0_cmd_byte_addr<29> has no load.
INFO:LIT:395 - The above info message is repeated 4 more times for the following
   (max. 5 shown):
   c3_p0_cmd_byte_addr<28>,
   c3_p0_cmd_byte_addr<27>,
   c3_p0_cmd_byte_addr<26>,
   c3_p0_cmd_byte_addr<0>
   To see the details of these info messages, please use the -detail switch.
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.
INFO:Pack:1716 - Initializing temperature to 85.000 Celsius. (default - Range:
   0.000 to 85.000 Celsius)
INFO:Pack:1720 - Initializing voltage to 1.140 Volts. (default - Range: 1.140 to
   1.260 Volts)
INFO:Map:215 - The Interim Design Summary has been generated in the MAP Report
   (.mrp).
INFO:Place:834 - Only a subset of IOs are locked. Out of 180 IOs, 45 are locked
   and 135 are not locked. If you would like to print the names of these IOs,
   please set the environment variable XIL_PAR_DESIGN_CHECK_VERBOSE to 1.
